# craftable-invisible-item-frames: (boolean)
#    -> allows anyone to craft invisible item frames from 8 normal frames in a chest pattern and one fermented eye in the middle
# double-shulker-shells: (boolean)
#    -> shulkers drop 1-2 shulker shells instead of having 50% chance to drop one
# wandering-trader:
#    -> any changes made to custom trades will not affect already spawned wandering traders!
#    no-wandering-trader-spawn: (boolean)
#        -> disables wandering trader spawning (also no trade llamas, EVEN FROM EGGS!), you can also prevent natural trader spawning by setting doTraderSpawning gamerule to false!
#    custom-trades:
#        enabled: (boolean)
#            -> use custom trades for wandering trader
#        remove-vanilla-trades: (boolean)
#            -> removes default vanilla trades (WANDERING TRADER WILL HAVE NO TRADES IF YOU DON'T SUPPLY YOUR OWN)
