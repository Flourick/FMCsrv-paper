# AFK module configuration file
# movement, chat and commands make player no longer AFK
# ---
# afk-timeout: (time in seconds)
#    -> time before player is considered AFK
#    -> value must be bigger than afk-check-period, bigger than 30 and less than 86400 (24h)
#       OR set to -1 to not check periodically at all
# afk-check-period: (time in seconds)
#    -> how often every player gets checked for AFK status, higher values have less impact on performance
#       but even for the biggest servers 5 seconds is more than enough to have negligible impact, I recommend leaving it as is
#    -> by setting to to 10 it can take up to 10 seconds for the module to realize that the player is no longer AFK!
#    -> value must be between 1 and 10
# announce-afk-in-chat: (boolean)
#    -> sends a message to all players that {PLAYER} is now AFK or is no longer AFK. Supports colors using '&' or '§' symbol
