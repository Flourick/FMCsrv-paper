# ColorMe module configuration file

# use-vanilla-teams-for-coloring:
#   Uses the vanilla teams instead of the bukkit API to provide
#   players with colors. Has the advantage of the color showing
#   in more places such as joining, pets etc. Do not use when
#   you have any other use for teams. You MUST enable this option
#   in paper.yml too if you wish to use it
